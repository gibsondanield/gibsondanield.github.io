# Exposure Plot TODO

## UI/Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile devices and different screen sizes - see what's broken

## Labeling
- [x] When sensor is Full Frame (1.0), don't show "[FF equiv]" label on aperture axis

## Core Math Rework
- [x] Don't move apertures on the axis when changing sensor size
- [x] EV/ISO values change as a function of sensor size (crop factor affects the result, not the input axis)

## Visualization Fixes
- [x] Fix the EV gradient background - simplified to vertical gradient

## Reference Points
- [ ] Make reference points that actually make sense for real photography scenarios
- [x] Research and find EV labels with accurate, meaningful descriptions (ANSI/Kodak standards)

*Keep the current UI aesthetic - it's looking good*
